SCRIPT_NAME="Push Notifications for Nextcloud"
SCRIPT_EXPLAINER="$SCRIPT_NAME attempts to solve the issue where Nextcloud clients have to \
periodically check the server if any files have been changed, new activities were created, \
or a notification was created/processed/dismissed, which increases the load on the server. \
By providing a way for the server to send update notifications to the clients, \
the need for the clients to make these checks can be greatly reduced, \
which reduces the load on the servern and delivers notifications to the clients in some cases faster."

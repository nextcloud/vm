msg_box "Bitwarden is a password manager that is seperate from Nextcloud, though we provide this service because it's self hosted and secure.

If you just want to run Bitwarden locally (not connecting your smartphone) then you can use 'localhost' as domain.
If you on the other hand want to run this on a domain, then please create a DNS record and point it to this server.
In the process of setting up Bitwarden you will be asked to generate an SSL cert with Let's Enrypt so no need to get your own prior to this setup.

The script is based on this documentation: https://help.bitwarden.com/article/install-on-premise/
It's a good idea to read that before you start this script.

Please also report any issues regarding this script setup to $ISSUES"

msg_box "The necessary preparations to run expose Bitwarden to the internet are:
1. The HTTP proxy and HTTPS ports for Bitwarden are 8080 and 8443, please open those ports before running this script.
2. Please create a DNS record and point that to this server.
3. Raise the amount of RAM to this server to at least 3 GB."

|      Welcome to the first setup of your own Nextcloud Server! :)      |
|                                                                       |

| You can find the complete install instructions here:                  |
| Nextcloud VM              = https://bit.ly/2S8eGfS                    |
| Nextcloud Home/SME Server = https://bit.ly/2k2TNaM                    |
|                                                                       |
| To be 100% sure that all the keystrokes work correctly (like @),      |
| please use an SSH terminal like Putty. You can download it here:      |
| https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html        |
| If you are running Windows 10 1809 or later, you can simply use SSH   |
| from the command prompt.                                              |
| Connect like this: ssh ncadmin@local.IP.of.this.server                |
|                                                                       |
| You can schedule the Nextcloud update process using a cron job.       |
| This is done using a script built into this server that automatically |
| updates Nextcloud, sets secure permissions, and logs the successful   |
| update to $VMLOGS/update.log                               |
| Just choose to configure it when asked to do so later in this script. |
|                                                                       |

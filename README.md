## Build your own VM, or install on a VPS
DigitalOcean example: https://youtu.be/LlqY5Y6P9Oc<br>
The script will mount and format the drive. Please select Manually Format & Mount when adding the second volume.

#### Minimum requirements:
* A clean [Ubuntu Server 18.04.X](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04/release/) using the alternative installer
* OpenSSH (preferred)
* 20 GB HDD for OS
* XX GB HDD for DATA (/mnt/ncdata)
* Absolute minimum is 1 vCPU and 2 GB RAM (4 GB minimum if you are running OnlyOffice)
* A working internet connection (the script needs it to download files and variables)
* [VMware Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html) (fully tested with Hyper-V and KVM as well).

#### Recommended
* DHCP available
* 40 GB HDD for OS
* 4 vCPU
* 4 GB RAM

#### Installation
1. Get the latest install script from master and install it with a sudo user:<br>
`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh | sudo bash`
2. When the VM is installed it will automatically reboot. Remember to login with the user you created:<br>
`ssh <user>@IP-ADDRESS`<br>
If it automatically runs as root when you reboot the machine, you have to abort it by pressing `CTRL+C` and run the script as the user you just created:<br>
`sudo -u <user> sudo bash /var/scripts/nextcloud-startup-script.sh` <br>
3. Please note that the installation/setup is *not* finished by just running the `nextcloud_install_production.sh` When you login with the (new) sudo user you ran the script with in step 2 you will automatically be presented with the setup script.

## Machine configuration of the released version
Please check the configuration [here](https://docs.hanssonit.se/s/W6fMouPiqQz3_Mog/virtual-machines-vm/d/W7Du9uPiqQz3_Mr1/machine-setup-nextcloud-vm).

## Do you want to run this on your Raspberry Pi?
Great news! We have forked this repository and created a Raspberry Pi image that you can download from here: 
https://github.com/techandme/NextBerry or here https://www.techandme.se/nextberry-rpi/.

We call it NextBerry and it's confirmed to be working on Raspberry Pi 2 & 3.

NOTE (2018-08-01): This is not maintained anymore, but keeping the info in case someone wants to pick it up again.

## I want to test RC!
No problem! We made it simple. Run `update.sh` but abort it before it starts so that you have the latest `nextcloud_update.sh`. Then put this in your `nextcloud_update.sh` below the curl command (lib.sh) but before everything else and run it:

To test a specific RC version:

```
NCREPO="https://download.nextcloud.com/server/prereleases"
NCVERSION=12.0.1RC5
STABLEVERSION="nextcloud-$NCVERSION"
```

Or the latest RC:
```
NCREPO="https://download.nextcloud.com/server/prereleases"
NCVERSION=$(curl -s -m 900 $NCREPO/ | sed --silent 's/.*href="nextcloud-\([^"]\+\).zip.asc".*/\1/p' | sort --version-sort | tail -1)
STABLEVERSION="nextcloud-$NCVERSION"
```

## FAQ

Keep asking questions so that we can add them here.

**Q: Where can i dowload VMware Player?**
<br />
**A:** You can download the latest release [here](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0).

**Q: Why are my apps are disabled during an upgrade?**
<br />
**A:** Check [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/11102#issuecomment-427685621
).

**Q: How to update Nextcloud VM?**
<br />
**A:** You cannot use the built in updater in Nextcloud GUI due to secure permissions on this VM. Use the built-in script instead:
`sudo bash /var/scripts/update.sh` or run `run_nextcloud_update` as root from your terminal.

**Q: How do I run the occ command?**
<br />
**A:** We've added an alias for that as well. As root, just run `nextcloud_occ`

<br />
**A:** https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/issues/629

**Q: Where do I tweak the settings for php-fpm?**
<br />
**A:** You can change the settings in `/etc/php/7.2/fpm/pool.d/nextcloud.conf`, but be aware; only change it if you know what you are doing!

**Q: I get NETWORK NOT OK when booting the VM. How do I solve that?**
<br />
**A:** There are a few causes to this error, most of them are your own network or firewall settings.
<br />
- Remove the VM NIC adapter in settings on VMware/Virtualbox and then re-adding a NIC adapter.

<br />
**A:** Please see here: https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/issues/200

**Q: Which Hyper-V generation should we chose when creating a machine to load this image?**
<br />
**A:** You currently need to use a 1st generation machine.

**Q: Do you have a pre-configured Hyper-V VM?**
<br />
**A:** Yes we have, you can download it here: https://shop.hanssonit.se/product/nextcloud-vm-microsoft-hyper-v-vhd/

**Q: I want a bigger version of this VM, where can I find that?**
<br />
**A:** You can download it here: https://shop.hanssonit.se/product/nextcloud-vm-500gb/

<br />
**A:** Extract the VM again and start over. The script can *not* be run twice in a row.

**Q: Does automatic update update Ubuntu and Nextcloud?**
<br />
**A:** if you want automatic updates of both Ubuntu and Nextcloud then check out this blog post: https://www.techandme.se/nextcloud-update-is-now-fully-automated/

**Q: Can I enable-disable automatic update later of OS/Nextcloud?**
<br />

## Build your own VM, or install on a VPS
DigitalOcean example: https://youtu.be/LlqY5Y6P9Oc

#### Minimum requirements:
* A clean Ubuntu Server 16.04.X
* OpenSSH (preferred)
* 20 GB HDD
* At least 1 vCPU and 2 GB RAM (4 GB minimum if you are running OnlyOffice)
* A working internet connection (the script needs it to download files and variables)

#### Recommended
* Thick provisioned (better performance and easier to maintain)
* DHCP available

#### Installation
1. Get the latest install script from master:<br>
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/postgresql/nextcloud_install_production.sh`
2. Run the script with:<br>
`sudo bash nextcloud_install_production.sh`
3. When the VM is installed it will automatically reboot. Remember to login with the user you created:<br>
`ssh <user>@IP-ADDRESS`<br>
If it automatically runs as root when you reboot the machine, you have to abort it by pressing `CTRL+C` and run the script as the user you just created:<br>
`sudo -u <user> sudo bash /var/scripts/nextcloud-startup-script.sh` <br>
4. Please note that the installation/setup is *not* finnished by just running the `nextcloud_install_production.sh` When you login with the (new) sudo user you ran the script with in step 2 you will automatically be presented with the setup script.

## Machine configuration of the released version
Please check the configuration here: https://www.techandme.se/machine-setup-nextcloud/

## Do you want to run this on your Raspberry Pi?
Great news! We have forked this repository and created a Raspberry Pi image that you can download from here: 
https://github.com/techandme/NextBerry or here https://www.techandme.se/nextberry-rpi/.

We call it NextBerry and it's confirmed to be working on Raspberry Pi 2 & 3.

**Q: How to update Nextcloud VM?**
<br />

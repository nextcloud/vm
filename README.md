## Build Requirements
These requirements are only applied if you build from the scripts:
* Ubuntu Server 16.04 Server
* OpenSSH (preferred)

If you install this on a clean Ubuntu 16.04 VM, the only script you need to run is "nextcloud_install_production.sh". All the other scripts are fetched from this repository during the installation.

It would be really nice if someone could develop the scripts so that they worked "out of the box", ẃithout having to use a "base VM" with Ubuntu 16.04 pre-installed. Vagrant is an option.

## Machine configuration

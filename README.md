## Build your own VM, or install on a VPS
DigitalOcean example: https://youtu.be/LlqY5Y6P9Oc

#### Minimum requirements:
* A clean Ubuntu Server 16.04.X
* OpenSSH (preferred)
* 20 GB HDD
* At least 1 vCPU and 2 GB RAM (4 GB minimum if you are running OnlyOffice)
* A working internet connection (the script needs it to download files and variables)

#### Recommended
* Thick provisioned (better performance and easier to maintain)
* DHCP available

#### Installation
1. Get the latest install script from master:<br>
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/master/nextcloud_install_production.sh`
2. Run the script with:<br>
`sudo bash nextcloud_install_production.sh`
3. When the VM is installed it will automatically reboot. Remember to login with the user you created:<br>
`ssh <user>@IP-ADDRESS`<br>
If it automatically runs as root when you reboot the machine, you have to abort it by pressing `CTRL+C` and run the script as the user you just created:<br>
`sudo -u <user> sudo bash /var/scripts/nextcloud-startup-script.sh` <br>
4. Please note that the installation/setup is *not* finnished by just running the `nextcloud_install_production.sh` When you login with the (new) sudo user you ran the script with in step 2 you will automatically be presented with the setup script.

## Machine configuration of the released version
Please check the configuration here: https://www.techandme.se/machine-setup-nextcloud/

## Do you want to run this on your Raspberry Pi?
Great news! We have forked this repository and created a Raspberry Pi image that you can download from here: 
https://github.com/techandme/NextBerry or here https://www.techandme.se/nextberry-rpi/.

We call it NextBerry and it's confirmed to be working on Raspberry Pi 2 & 3.

## I want to test RC!
No problem! We made it simple. Run `update.sh` but abort it before it starts so that you have the latest `nextcloud_update.sh`. Then put this in your `nextcloud_update.sh` below the curl command (lib.sh) but before everything else and run it:

To test a specific RC version:

```
NCREPO="https://download.nextcloud.com/server/prereleases"
NCVERSION=12.0.1RC5
STABLEVERSION="nextcloud-$NCVERSION"
```

Or the latest RC:
```
NCREPO="https://download.nextcloud.com/server/prereleases"
NCVERSION=$(curl -s -m 900 $NCREPO/ | sed --silent 's/.*href="nextcloud-\([^"]\+\).zip.asc".*/\1/p' | sort --version-sort | tail -1)
STABLEVERSION="nextcloud-$NCVERSION"
```

## Do you run Spreed.ME but it's not working correctly?
Then you need to disable any AdBlocker that you might have enabled.

## FAQ

Keep asking questions so that we can add them here.

**Q: Where can i dowload VMware Player?**
<br />
**A:** You can download the latest release [here](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0).

**Q: Why is the downloaded file is just a few kilobyte, or corrupted?**
<br />
**A:** This is due to heavy load on the server. Please try again in a few minutes.

**Q: The script says: "WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface yet. Use with caution in scripts"**
<br />
**A:** http://askubuntu.com/a/463966

**Q: I get NETWORK NOT OK when booting the VM. How do I solve that?**
<br />
**A:** There are a few causes to this error, most of them are your own network or firewall settings.
<br />
- Remove the VM NIC adapter in settings on VMware/Virtualbox and then re-adding a NIC adapter.
![alt_tag](https://goo.gl/gWg9JN)
- Check your firewall so that it doesn't block this specific IP
- Check your router/firewall that you have DHCP enabled.

**Q: I get a message that I'm not root, but I am.**
<br />
**A:** Please see here: https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/issues/200

**Q: Which Hyper-V generation should we chose when creating a machine to load this image?**
<br />
**A:** You currently need to use a 1st generation machine.

**Q: Do you have a pre-configured Hyper-V VM?**
<br />
**A:** Yes we have, you can download it here: https://shop.techandme.se/index.php/product/nextcloud-vm-microsoft-hyper-v-vhd/

**Q: I want a bigger version of this VM, where can I find that?**
<br />
**A:** You can download it here: https://shop.techandme.se/index.php/product/nextcloud-vm-500gb/

<br />
**A:** Just submit your report here: https://github.com/nextcloud/vm/issues/new

**Q: How to update Nextcloud VM?**
<br />
**A:** You can not use the built in updater in Nextcloud GUI due to secure permissions on this VM. Use the built in script instead:
`sudo bash /var/scripts/update.sh`

**Q: How to install apps if not selected during first install?**
<br />
**A:** Go to the apps folder in this repo and download the script in raw format and run them. For the calendar:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/master/apps/calendar.sh && sudo bash calendar.sh`

**Q: How to continue from partially installed system? - You got the FQDN wrong/You put in a bad password/ etc...**

**A:** Extract the VM again and start over. The script can *not* be run twice in a row.

**Q: Does automatic update update Ubuntu and Nextcloud?**
<br />
**A:** if you want automatic updates of both Ubuntu and Nextcloud then check out this blog post: https://www.techandme.se/nextcloud-update-is-now-fully-automated/

**Q: Can I enable-disable automatic update later of OS/Nextcloud?**
<br />
**A:** Yes, it's controlled by a cronjob. Just disable the cronjob to disable automatic updates.

<br />
**A:** There are several ways. We recomend Rsync to a NAS or similar. You can find a script here: https://www.techandme.se/rsync-backup-script/

**Q:  Can I install in a VM with a NAT and port redirection of port 443 & 10000 & 22?**
<br />
**A:** Yes, check this out: https://www.techandme.se/publish-your-server-online/

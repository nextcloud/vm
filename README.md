## Build Requirements
These requirements are only applied if you build from the scripts:
* Ubuntu Server 16.04.X Server
* OpenSSH (preferred)

If you install this on a clean Ubuntu 16.04.X VM, the only script you need to run is "nextcloud_install_production.sh". All the other scripts are fetched from this repository during the installation.

## Machine configuration

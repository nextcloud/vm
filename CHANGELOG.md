### Good to know
- If you plan to install apps that use docker containers such as Collabora or Full Text Search, you need to raise the amount of RAM to at least 4 GB. If you don't, the startup script will fail to set enough max_children to the PHP-FPM configuration as we calculate on available RAM, and not the total.

    Collabora requires 2 GB additional RAM
    Full Text Search requires 2 GB additional RAM

If you run Hyper-V or want 500 GB, 1 TB or 2 TB VM you can download it from [T&M Hansson IT's shop](https://shop.hanssonit.se/product-category/virtual-machine/nextcloud/). 
**Please note that BOTH disks need to be imported when using the Hyper-V image. The disk ending with _OS for OS, and the disk ending with _DATA for DATA.**

PR's are more than welcome. Happy Nextclouding!

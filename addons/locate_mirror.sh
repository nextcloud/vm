SCRIPT_EXPLAINER="To make downloads as fast as possible when updating Ubuntu \
you should download mirrors that are as geographically close to you as possible.

Please note that there are no guarantees that the download mirrors \
this script finds will remain for the lifetime of this server.
Because of this, we don't recommend that you change the mirror unless you live far away from the default.

This is the method used: https://github.com/vegardit/fast-apt-mirror.sh"

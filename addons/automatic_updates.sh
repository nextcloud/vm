msg_box "This option will update your server every week on Saturdays at $AUT_UPDATES_TIME:00.
The update will run the built in script '$SCRIPTS/update.sh' which will update both the server packages and Nextcloud itself.

You can read more about it here: https://www.techandme.se/nextcloud-update-is-now-fully-automated/
Please keep in mind that automatic updates might fail hence it's \
important to have a proper backup in place if you plan to run this option.

You can disable the automatic updates by entering the crontab file like this:
'sudo crontab -e -u root'
Then just put a hash (#) in front of the row that you want to disable.

In the next step you will be able to choose to proceed or exit." "$SUBTITLE"

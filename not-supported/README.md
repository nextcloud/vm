# What is this subfolder about?
This subdirectory of the Nextcloud VM contains scripts that are not yet ready for getting into the Release version.

## Can I help?
Yes, of course! :)<br>
Although some things in those scripts might not be 100% ready, we would love to hear your feedback regarding those.
Feedback is especially welcome, if you would love to have some features that those scripts bring in the release version of the NcVM.<br>
So please report back! ðŸš€

### How to run this inside my NcVM?
We have prepared a Menu for you to choose from available options. You can download the Menu with the following command:<br>
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/master/not-supported/not-supported.sh -P /var/scripts`<br>
After downloading the Menu, you just run it with the following command:<br>
`sudo bash /var/scripts/not-supported.sh`<br>
Running this second command will show the Menu with the latest options to choose from.

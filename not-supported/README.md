# What is this subfolder about?
This subdirectory of the Nextcloud VM contains scripts that probably *never* will get merged into the released version, but we keep them here so that users can test, and enjoy the benefits of having an easy way to set up the different software offered in this sub-folder. Freedom of choice basically.

## Can I help?
Yes, of course! :)<br>
Although most of the scripts might not be 100% ready, we would love to hear your feedback anyway.
Feedback is especially welcome, if you would like to add some features that these scripts bring in the released version of the NcVM.<br>
So, please report back! 🚀

## How to run this inside my NcVM?
We have prepared a menu for you to choose from available options. You can download the menu with the following command:<br>
`sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/main/not-supported/not-supported.sh -P /var/scripts`<br>
After downloading the menu, you just run it with the following command:<br>
`sudo bash /var/scripts/not-supported.sh`<br>
Running the not-supported script will show the menu with the latest options to choose from.

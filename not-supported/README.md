# What is this subfolder about?
This subdirectory of the Nextcloud VM contains scripts that probably *never* will get merged into the released version, but we keep them here so that users can test, and enjoy the befnefits of having an easy way set it up. Freedom of choice basically.
## Can I help?
Yes, of course! :)<br>
Although some things in those scripts might not be 100% ready, we would love to hear your feedback regarding those.
Feedback is especially welcome, if you would love to have some features that those scripts bring in the released version of the NcVM.<br>
So please report back! ðŸš€

### How to run this inside my NcVM?
We have prepared a menu for you to choose from available options. You can download the menu with the following command:<br>
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/master/not-supported/not-supported.sh -P /var/scripts`<br>
After downloading the menu, you just run it with the following command:<br>
`sudo bash /var/scripts/not-supported.sh`<br>
Running this second command will show the menu with the latest options to choose from.

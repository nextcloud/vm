# What is this subfolder about?
This subdirectory of the Nextcloud VM contains scripts that are not yet ready for getting into the Release version.

## Can I help?
Yes, of course! :)
Although some things in those scripts might not be 100% ready, we would love to hear your feedback regarding those.
Feedback is especially welcome, if you would love to have some features that those script brings in the Release version of the NcVM.
So please report back! 🚀

### How to run this inside my NcVM?
Currently there is only one script inside this folder. The command to get and run this script is the following:<br>
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/vm/szaimen-patch-1/not-supported/smbserver.sh && sudo bash smbserver.sh`

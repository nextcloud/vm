[For the Nextcloud VM:]
Please delete this VM from your host and reimport it once again, then run this setup like you did the first time.

[For the Nextcloud Home/SME Server:]
It's a bit more tricky since you can't revert in the same way as with a VM. The best thing you can do now is to save all the output from the session you ran before this one + write down all the steps you took and send and email to:
github@hanssonit.se with the subject 'Issues with first setup', and we'll take it from there.

1. Publish your server online: https://goo.gl/iUGE2U

2. To login to PostgreSQL just type: sudo -u postgres psql nextcloud_db

3. To update this VM just type: sudo bash /var/scripts/update.sh

4. Change IP to something outside DHCP: sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

5. For a better experience it's a good idea to setup an email account here:

Please delete this VM from your host and reimport it once again, then run this setup like you did the first time.

[For the Nextcloud Home/SME Server:]
It's a bit more tricky since you can't revert in the same way as with a VM. The best thing you can do now is to save all the output from the session you ran before this one + write down all the steps you took and send and email to:
github@hanssonit.se with the subject 'Issues with first setup', and we'll take it from there.
